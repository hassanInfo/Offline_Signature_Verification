# Offline Signature Verification

</div>

This repository contains a demo of my capstone project titled "Writer Independent Offline Signature Verification," developed during my end-of-studies internship for the completion of my master's program. 

The objective of our method is to overcome challenges associated with variations in signature appearance that traditional Writer-Dependent (WD) methods find challenging to handle. We developed a Deep Learning model capable of learning a robust visual representation from offline handwritten signatures. This learned representation can be effectively utilized for feature extraction in downstream tasks within Writer-Dependent systems.
